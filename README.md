## Description

For this task, students had to create a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm) and had to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

This challenge was really fun to complete, using jquery is shorter than using native JavaScript which makes things easier and using Day.Js was fun as well because it is simple but challenging API for beginners.
